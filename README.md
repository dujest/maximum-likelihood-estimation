The basic problem is to determine the best failure distribution implied by n failure times comprised in a sample. In all cases the sample is assumed to be a simple random (or probability) sample where the failure or repaire times are independent observations from a common population.

There are two general approaches to fitting reliability distributions to failure data. The first, and usually preferred, method is to fit a theoretical distribution, such as exponential, Weibull, normal or lognormal distribution. The second is to derive, directly from the collected data, an empirical reliability function or hazard rate function.
